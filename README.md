# AutoMoL
Automated Monadic Logic in the Scala programming language.

## Quick start
To use the first order evaluation theorem prover, clone the repo and run the following commands:

    sbt compile
    sbt fastOptJS
    sbt server/run

Then navigate to localhost:8080 in your favorite browser and enjoy the devilishly primitive (yet mostly functional) web interface.
